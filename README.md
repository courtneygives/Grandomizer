# Grandomizer

Read the full [Scope](https://goo.gl/S81WXp). Or don't.

## Description

This is a tool for instructors and classroom leaders to randomly divide participants within a cohort (or class) into smaller groups. The instructor will be able to create groups by entering the desired number of members in a group, or by entering the desired total number of groups.

## Details

Now that the instruction phase of the curriculum is, for the most part, complete, it is far easier to imagine building a “full-stack” application. The Grandomizer will be a showcase for a majority of the technologies that have been imparted to us in the past few weeks. The idea for a group randomizer was not a novel one, but rather an assignment that most Prime students have attempted. As a large solo project, however, the idea of expanding on the original assignment and creating a “fancy” group randomizer from scratch should prove useful to the instructors at Prime.
